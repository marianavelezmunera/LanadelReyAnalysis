# LanadelReyAnalysis
This is a mini project to rate and analyze all Lana del Rey's discography.
Basicaly I listened to all Lana del Rey's songs and rated them based on: How much I like the song, if I think it is a skip, my opinion on the lyrics (if it is a masterpiece, a normal song or a cringy song) and if I relate or have related to the song. 

All info was analyzed using R. All code is going to be readily available, including the data that can be used as a template to do your own ranking! 
Theese are the main results, results per album are in the folders.
